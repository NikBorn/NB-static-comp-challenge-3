# NB-static-comp-challenge-3
third static comp challenge for MOD 1

I split the page up into two large divs and used Flex to position them correctly.  The div on the right side is further broken down, using Flex.  I should have used a table instead of a group of divs for the table portion of the page.  I have my CSS grouped by website layout and it should closely mirror my HTML.
